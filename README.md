# AchyBrakeyHeart_FrontEnd
At HackUTD IX, I was responsible for developing the UI for our application AchyBrakeyHeart using Android Studio. This was a challenge for me because this was my first time developing an application.

Taken from our Devpost submission.
Inspiration:
Annually, there are 131,000 injuries and fatalities due to brake failure. We are measuring the impact force of braking on the brakes to reduce roadway injuries and fatalities, prevent spontaneous maintenance, and reduce car emissions. We were inspired by Toyota's challenge to improve the end-to-end vehicle experience and State Farm's challenge to solve a problem our community (fellow drivers) faces. We feel that our application increases the quality of one's driving experience by reducing the chance of needing surprise maintenance or brake failure.

What it Does:
Our project essentially uses a accelerometer to estimate someone's current break health and the amount of time before their breaks must be replaced. Then, it displays this information and various other information to the user's screen.
